The fantasy of a universal language is at least as old as the story of the Tower of Babel, though speaking ‘the same language’ as someone else is no guarantee of understanding them. Babel: Adventures in Translation, an exhibition at the Bodleian Library until 2 June, begins with monolingual dictionaries: A Table Alphabeticall, compiled by Robert Cawdrey and published in 1604; and Richard Head’s compendium of criminal slang, An Alphabetical Canting Vocabulary, printed in 1673. It defines ‘booz’ as ‘drink’, ‘been darkmans’ as ‘good night’, and ‘bite the roger’ as ‘steal the portmanteau’.

The Bible is itself a useful ‘debabelisation’ tool. Translations of it, as Matthew Reynolds writes in his contribution to the book accompanying the exhibition, led to ‘extraordinary feats of scholarship and book-making’, some of them on display at the Bodleian. A 1602 Bishops’ Bible has marginal notes by some of the King James translators; the Complutensian Polyglot, created in Spain in the 16th century, contains parallel texts in Hebrew, Greek, Latin and Aramaic. The number of languages the entire Bible has been translated into currently stands at 683, which makes it a handy data corpus for anyone trying to devise a global means of communication for humans and machines alike.

Mathematics is sometimes described as a universal language. The first English version of Euclid’s Elements, translated by Henry Billingsley in 1570, includes pop-up geometric solids. The Welsh mathematician Robert Recorde, in his 1557 book The Whetstone of Witte, introduced the + and – signs into English: the former a stylisation of the Latin word et, the latter derived from meno, once abbreviated as m̄. Recorde also invented the = sign, choosing ‘a paire of paralleles … bicause noe .2. thynges, can be moare equalle’.

Today, on the Kerstdag, I am writing from the beautiful village [Aldtsjerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldtsjerk) in Friesland. 
This short article is about an amusing pairing of Beethoven's Egmont Overture with ... well, what you are about to see.

After the opening title card, a white blur in the center of a black screen resolves to the shape of a chicken egg. We penetrate the shell, and watch, in time-lapse, the 21-day development of a chicken embryo, from a germ spot on the yolk to the emergence of the baby chick compressed into under eight minutes. The short film is set to Beethoven's Egmont Overture

In Goethe's poetry and Beethoven's music this resistance is a heroic story of a personal sacrifice for planting the seeds of eventual liberation.  


_Overture_ (Hungarian: Nyitány) is a 1965 Hungarian short film written by János Vadász. It won the Short Film Palme d'Or at the 1965 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egmont_(play)) the movie has been described as <q>one of the most influential short films in film history</q> and <q>among the most ingenious pairings of music and image in the history of the festival</q>.<label for="sn-egmont-overture" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-egmont-overture" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See [MTV's description](http://www.mtv.com/news/2770646/best-cannes-short-films/)</span>
