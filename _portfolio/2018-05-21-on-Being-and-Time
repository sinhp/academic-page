## Where is Heidegger's thinking situtated? 

We note that Heidegger comes from a very conservative catholic background; his goal in his youth was to become a Catholic priest and he became one, indeed very much attracted to an extremely conservative Catholic priest and preacher of 17th century Abraham a Sancta Clara from near Messkirch the same region as Heidegger. In his time Sancta Clara was descibed as "a very eccentric but popular Augustinian monk".
