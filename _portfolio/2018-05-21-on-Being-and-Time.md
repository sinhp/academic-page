## Where is Heidegger's thinking situtated? 

We note that Heidegger comes from a very conservative catholic background; his goal in his youth was to become a Catholic priest and he became one, indeed very much attracted to an extremely conservative Catholic priest and preacher of 17th century Abraham a Sancta Clara from near Messkirch the same region as Heidegger. In his time Sancta Clara was described as "a very eccentric but popular Augustinian monk". 

Heidegger soon broke with his Catholicism when in Austria and he gave up the path to fame from priesthood, the path his idol has treaded in 17th century, the provincial inclinations and   




Although Heidegger, after the turn (Kehre), takes an opposite view on the use of neologism in his thinking in [The End of Philosophy and The Task of Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouZC17_Vsg), I still think that the precise use of neologism in Being and Time is an essential component of the masterpiece and necessary to what aims at delivering.  


Antihumanism 


As Peter Sloterdijk writes in 

> For Heidegger there is no path
from humanism to this acute ontological exercise in humility. He sees it rather as a
contribution to the history of the disarmament of subjectivity. Actually, Heidegger
interprets the historical world of Europe as the theater of militant humanism; it is
the battlefield on which human subjectivity, with portentous consequences, has acted
out its domination over Being. From this perspective, humanism is seen as the natural
accomplice of all possible tortures which could be inflicted in the name of human
well-being.
