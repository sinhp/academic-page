`Abstract:` Categorifying the comprehension scheme of ZF naturally leads to the notion of the subobjectclassifier, namely the ‚Äútrue‚Äù morphism from the terminal object to the truth object of the categoryis the universal subobject and any subobject is obtained as a pullback of the universal subobject.It also yields the epi-mono factorization system in the category.Going one level higher, it was first realized by Street and Walters ([1]) that category ofpointed sets discretely opfibred over the category of sets plays the same role as the subobjectclassifier. This was internalized in suitably structured 2-categories. Similarly the comprehensionconstruction yields that discrete opfibrations and initial functors form a factorization system.There is a dual comprehensive factorization system, namely that of discrete fibrations and finalfunctors.Going yet another dimension higher, we introduce the notion ofcomprehension constructionsfor bicategories([10]) (that is internal to the tricategory Hom of bicategories, pseudo functors,pseudo natural transformations, and modifications). This will rely on earlier work on fibrationsof bicategories ([4], [5], [6]).For us, the main example is the bicategory ofgeneralized spaces(that is Grothendieck toposesdefined over a varying elementary base) fibred over the bicategory of elementary toposes andgeometric morphisms. We use the structure of comprehension to prove results about fibrationsand opfibrations of toposes from fibrational extension of generalized geometric theories ([9]).As we shall see the notions of (op)fibration of toposes have close connections to topologicalproperties. For instance, every local homeomorphism is an opfibration while every fibrewiseStone space is a fibration.To study fibrations of toposes, Johnstone defined fibrations internal to 2-categories ([3]). Iftoposes are taken to be bounded over some fixed baseS, the analysis of fibrations and opfibrationsin the 2-categoryBTop=Sof bounded toposes over baseSis much easier than the general casewhere there is no canonical choice of base topos and one has to work in the 2-categoryBTop.Indeed, Johnstone proved several important (op)fibrational results inBTop.I will introduce the 2-categoryConof Arithmetic Universe (AU) contexts developed by Vickers([7], [8]). It provides a language to reason about geometric construction within the predicativefragment of internal language of toposes, that is within the language of Arithmetic Universes.Borrowing from work of Street ([2]), we introduce a syntactic notion of (op)fibration inConwhich is based on Chevalley‚Äôs internal characterization of fibrations obtained as a theorem inthere. Note that Johnstone‚Äôs definition of internal (op)fibrations is more general than Chevalley‚Äôsdefinition: neither strictness of 2-categories nor the existence of the structure of strict pullbacksand comma objects are assumed.

I shall explain our result that gives a recipe for obtaining (op)fibrations of toposes from thefinitary syntactic (op)fibrations of contexts ([9]). The scafolding of the proof of this result isbased on a certain comprehension bicategory involving fibred bicategory of generalized spacesover elementary toposes.As an applications of this result, I will discuss the construction of the colimits of Grothendiecktopos from generalized point-freebag contexts. Hopefully, this sheds some light on the relation-ship between AUs and traditional Grothendieck topos theory.
