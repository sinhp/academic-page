I am a mathematician working in the foundation of mathematics and its connection to theoretical computer science. My main research interests include constructive mathematics and type theory, category theory and categorical logic, and higher category theory. I am also interested in applications of these areas to topology and algberaic topology. On the side, I recently started to learn more about Topological Data Analysis and Persistent Homology. 

I was born in Qeshm Island in Iran. I have lived in Canada, UK, and the Netherlands. I speak Persian, English, and Dutch. 	


## Academic Profile

During Nov 2019 - Nov 2020 , I was a Research Fellow at the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds working on the project <em>Univalent type theories: models, equalities, and coherence</em> in collaboration with Prof. Nicola Gambino (University of Leeds) and Prof. Steve Awodey (Carnegie Mellon University) to develop a Kripke-Joyal style forcing semantics for Homotopy Type Theory. This semantics extends the usual Kripke-Joyal Semantics for IHOL (Higher Order Intuitionistic Logic) in toposes. 

Before that I was a PhD student in Theoretical Computer Science at the University of Birmingham under supervision of Prof. Steve Vickers. My PhD thesis was about some of the bicategorical aspects of topos theory arising from 2-categorical aspects of certain essentially algebraic theories corresponding to the logic of Arithmetic Universes. It was examined by Prof. Peter Johnstone and Prof. Martín Escardó. The main contribution of my thesis was the study point-free generalized spaces (modeled by Grothendieck toposes over varying bases) under the three principles of <em>geometricity, predicativity, and base-independence</em>. More on this in my <a href="/research/" target="_blank">research profile.</a>

Prior to joining Birmingham I was at Western University in London (Ontario) where I did my masters in pure mathematics. I learnt logic and category theory from <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/philosophy/people/bell.html" target="_blank">John Bell</a> and differential geometry from <a href="http://www-home.math.uwo.ca/~mpinson/" target="_blank">Martin Pinsonnault</a>.

Other interests 
======

I am fond of remote places in nature, museums, hiking, and photography. I am an avid reader of philosophy and history of philosophical thoughts and enjoy discussing them. Nietzsche, Heidegger, Foucault, and Sloterdijk have made the most impact on my thinking.  

Another interest of mine, related to the history of mathematics, is the history of the foundation and practice of mathematics in 19th and early 20th century. This includes for example Dedekind's foundational work in algebra and arithmetic, Klein's Erlangen Program in geometry, Frege's logicism, Husserl's phenomenology of mathematical thinking, the Formalism project of Hilbert and the ensuing axiomatic (re)turn in mathematics, Brouwer's intuitionism, Weyl's predicativism and his mediation between intuitionism and formalism, and Cassirer's structuralist account of mathematical knowledge. You can read more [here](https://sinhp.github.io/links/#phil-math:reading-list). Ocassionally, I will write some of my thoughts on range of issues of philosphical nature on <a href="/year-archive">my blog</a>.
