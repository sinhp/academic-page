I am a research student in foundation of mathematics and theoretical computer science. My main research interests include categorical logic, type theory, topos theory, and more recently higher category theory. Some of these subjects have close connections to fundamental concepts of computer science by either direct applications in computer science, providing proper foundation of discourse or sometimes being inspired by ideas from computer science such as computability.

 a member of <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/theory/" target="_blank">Theory of Computation</a> group at University of Birmingham.

With my advisor <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~sjv/" target="_blank">Steve Vickers</a> we have been investigating some 2-categorical aspects of toposes from logical point of view. To know more I invite you to look at my <a href="/research/" target="_blank">research profile.</a>

Prior to joining Birmingham I was in Western University in London Ontario where I did my masters in pure mathematics. 
My advisor was <a href="http://www-home.math.uwo.ca/~mpinson/" target="_blank">Prof. Martin Pinsonnault</a>. I was born in Iran and I have lived in Canada and UK. 	



Other interests 
======

I am fond of remote places in nature, museums, hiking, and photography. I am an avid reader of philosophy and history of philosophical thoughts and enjoy discussing them any opportunity I find. In particular, among classics, I read Aristotle, Voltaire, Kant, Hegel, and among contemporaries Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Searle, Foucault, and Badiou are closer to my taste. I used to find more free time during my undergraduate and masters years to read these folks but during my PhD years I do regret that I do not have much time to commit myself more seriously to reading some of heftier books. Maybe some [tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LDdyafsR7g)!    

Ocassionally, I will write some of my thoughts on range of issues of philosphical nature on <a href="/year-archive">my blog</a>. If you like to discuss those ideas further, I would appreciate if you leave your comments under the posts. 
I also write on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sinahazratpour).
