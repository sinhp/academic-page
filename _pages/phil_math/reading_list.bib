abstract={A very good stylish introduction to the pressing issues in the philosophy of mathematics, the article puts forward the view that proofs are primarily forms of mathematical discourse. It also gives a compelling critique of distinction between pure and applied mathematics by challenging the supremacy of "the tool view of mathematics" in our conceptualisation of role of mathematics. It feels to me that there is a clear influence of Heidegerrian realism and Foucucault's theory of discourse upon this article.},
