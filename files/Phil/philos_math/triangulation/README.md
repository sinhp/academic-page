Triangulations
==============

An implementation and presentation of selected mesh generation algorithms. To view online, follow this 
[link](http://mkacz91.github.io/Triangulations) (requires a modern browser and won't work on a mobile device).

This is a presentation initially created for my talk during the Numerical Algorithms Seminar held at the University of Wroc≈Çaw in 2015. The slides contain a theoretical description of the algorithms as well as their animated
visualizations, computed live by their JavaScript implementations.

This is not a Library
---------------------

If you're looking for a JavaScript library implementing the outlined algorithms, this is _not_ it. The purpose of the included implementation was solely to produce visualizations for the presentation. The algorithms are often asymptotically very suboptimal and even buggy.
