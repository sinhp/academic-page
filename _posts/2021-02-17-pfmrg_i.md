## PFMRG: the reading resources for the first phase

In the first few sessions we are going to learn about basic questions of philosophy of mathematics and get ourselves familiar with formal logic and formal proofs.
Track I:  Basic questions of philosophy of mathematics
I have picked two introductory resources:

 * Øystein Linnebo. Philosophy of Mathematics, Princeton University Press, 2017
 * David Corfield. Towards a Philosophy of Real Mathematics Cambridge University Press, 2006

Linnebo's book will be our main source. We will read and discuss almost all of its chapters. To be prepared for our 1st & 2nd sessions I recommend Reading chapters 1-4. Corfield's book is complementary to Linnebo's book; It gives a pluralistic point of view to the philosophy and foundations of mathematics. It is only supplementary for the first phase. I think Corfield's book will be a great source of ideas when we move on to the second phase of our reading group.
Track II: Introduction to formal logic and formal proofs
For this track we have the following reading materials:

  * [Bas van Fraassen. Formal semantics and logic](https://www.princeton.edu/~fraassen/Formal%20Semantics%20and%20Logic.pdf). Macmillan Co. New York 1971, newly digitized version 2016. 

  van Fraassen's book is based on his lectures in logic at Yale 1966–1968 and Indiana 1969–1970. These lectures were intended specifically for philosophy students. We will have a selected reading of chapters 1-3.

  * Aristotle. Prior Analytics, circa 350 BCE
  Translated by [A. J. Jenkinson](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/prior.htm)
  Other translations:
  Aristotle, Prior Analytics, translated by Robin Smith, Indianapolis: Hackett, 1989.
  Aristotle, Prior Analytics Book I, translated by Gisela Striker, Oxford: Clarendon Press 2009

  Aristotle's Prior Analytics is the first time in history when Logic is scientifically investigated. The book is famously about deductive reasoning, known as syllogism. This will be our first introduction to deductive reasoning.

  * C. S. Peirce. Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, volume 7. Harvard University Press, Cambridge,
  MA, 1935. Edited by C. Hartshorne, P. Weiss, and A.W. Bucks. Paragraph 218.
  * Jeremy Avigad. Reliability of mathematical inference. Synthese, pages 1–23, 2020
  * I. Lakatos. Proofs and Refutations. The Logic of Mathematical Discovery. Cambridge University Press. 2015
  * William Thurston. [On Proof and Progress in Mathematics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9404236.pdf). 1994.
