PFMRG: the first phase
In the first few sessions we are going to learn about basic questions of philosophy of mathematics and get ourselves familiar with formal logic and formal proofs.
Basic questions of philosophy of mathematics
I have picked two introductory resources:
1. Øystein Linnebo. Philosophy of Mathematics, Princeton University Press, 2017
2. David Corfield. Towards a Philosophy of Real Mathematics Cambridge University Press, 2006

Linnebo's book will be our main source. We will read and discuss almost all of its chapters. To be prepared for the 1st & 2nd sessions I recommend reading chapters 1-4.
Corfield's book is complementary to Linnebo's book; It gives a pluralistic point of view to the philosophy and foundations of mathematics. Reading it is a big bonus, but our main reading material is Linnebo's book. I think Corfield's book will be a great source of ideas when we move on to the second phase of our reading group.
Introduction to formal logic and formal proofs
We have three reading material:
1. Bas van Fraassen. Formal semantics and logic. Macmillan Co. New York 1971, newly digitized version 2016. https://www.princeton.edu/~fraassen/Formal%20Semantics%20and%20Logic.pdf
This book is based on van Fraassen's lectures in logic at Yale 1966–1968 and Indiana 1969–1970. These lectures were intended specifically for philosophy students.

2. Aristotle. Prior Analytics, circa 350 BCE
The first time in history when Logic is scientifically investigated and it is about deductive reasoning, known as syllogism.
