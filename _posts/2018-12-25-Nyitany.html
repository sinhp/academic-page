<p>Today, on the Kerstdag, I am writing from the beautiful village <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldtsjerk">Aldtsjerk</a> in Friesland. This short article is about an amusing pairing of Beethoven's Egmont Overture with ... well, what you are about to see, came to my way today.</p>
<p>After the opening title card, a white blur in the center of a black screen resolves to the shape of a chicken egg. We penetrate the shell, and watch, in time-lapse, the 21-day development of a chicken embryo, from a germ spot on the yolk to the emergence of the baby chick compressed into under eight minutes. The Short Film is set to Beethoven's Egmont Overture <label for="sn-egmont-overture" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-egmont-overture" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Beethoven's Egmont is a set of incidental music pieces for the 1787 play of the same name by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.</span> as the soundtrack for a series of images, featuring a hatching bird, referencing the rebellious nature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamoral,_Count_of_Egmont">Egmont's resistance</a> against King Philip II of the Spain. In Goethe's poetry and Beethoven's music this resistance is a heroic story of a personal sacrifice for planting the seeds of eventual liberation.</p>
<p>Overture (Hungarian: Nyitány) is a 1965 Hungarian short film written by János Vadász. It won the Short Film Palme d'Or at the 1965 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egmont_(play)">Wikipedia</a> the movie has been described as <q>one of the most influential short films in film history</q> and <q>among the most ingenious pairings of music and image in the history of the festival</q>.<label for="sn-egmont-overture" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-egmont-overture" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2770646/best-cannes-short-films/">MTV's description</a></span></p>
