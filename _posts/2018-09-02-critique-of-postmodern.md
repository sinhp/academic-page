There is an article today on Washington Post addressing recent vilifying and obfuscatory attacks on "postmodernism" in US media and celebratariatosphere from Conservatives, neo-Conservatives, Centrists, and Liberals.    

> Postmodern theory may be the most loathed concept ever to have emerged from academia. Developed within literature and philosophy departments in the 1970s, it _supposedly_ told us that facts were debatable, that individual perspectives mattered most, that shared meaning was an illusion and that universal truth was a myth. The right quickly identified these notions as a danger to the very foundations of society and spent decades flogging the university lefties who promoted them. In “Tenured Radicals,” Roger Kimball accused academic theorists of trying to redefine the traditional humanities as “a species of political grievance-mongering” for which virtue equals “whatever sexual, feminist, Marxist, racial, or ethnic agenda to which the particular critic has declared his allegiance.” Norman Podhoretz believed that postmodernism was an attack on moral order. More recently, Victor Davis Hanson faulted postmodernism for President Barack Obama’s handling of health care legislation, writing, “In the gospel of postmodern relativism, what did it matter if the president of the United States promised that Obamacare would not alter existing health-care plans when it was clear that it would?”

> Later, centrists and liberals searching for a culprit behind the ascent of Donald Trump and the war on fact that surrounds him joined the conservative crusade. Michiko Kakutani, the cultural critic and author of “The Death of Truth,” blames the relativism that facilitated Trump’s rise on “academics promoting the gospel of postmodernism.” Lamenting the state of American politics under Trump, philosopher Daniel Dennett said in an interview last year, “I think what the postmodernists did was truly evil.” And when Rudy Giuliani recently told NBC’s Chuck Todd that “truth isn’t truth,” Vox claimed that it wasn’t “the first time Trump’s legal team has played postmodernist and hinted that it might be too hard to discern the truth because it’s all relative anyway.” (Aaron Hanlon, [Postmodernism didn’t cause Trump. It explains him.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/postmodernism-didnt-cause-trump-it-explains-him/2018/08/30/0939f7c4-9b12-11e8-843b-36e177f3081c_story.html?utm_term=.c2cc12038dd7) )

These obfuscations are not much worth our time here, and suffices to say two things: first, that concpiracy theories do not come from fringes of society only, but also, though perhaps in more fanciful language, from the cynic ruling class as well as bourgeois academics and academic careerists. The common diagnosis of it, as Fredric Jameson points out quite accurately, is poor cognitive mapping in the complex postmodern age. Second, that postmodernism is perhaps one of the most misunderstood terms among the people foreign to philosophical traditions of the 20th century, in particular the French philosophical movements of late half of the 20th century. It is _NOT_ a system of beliefs, it did not refer to a fixed set of self-identified-as-postmodern thinkers, and certainly there were not secret meetings between them to conspire and plan for future ascendency of Trump to power in 2016. It is very hard to describe, let alone define postmodernism. However, some of the common concerns in postmodern thinkers was condition of human life in late capitalism. This includes critique of culture, media, power, etc. Many of the philosophers who are commonly called postmodern are also called other things; a great example is Foucault who has also been called a structuralist. If one attempts at tracing postmodernism based on the ideas and not just as a name of an era, then Nietzche and Heidegger should be counted as postmodern thinkers.     


Today I want to introduce two postmodernist (or rather critique of postmodernism) works, one philosophical and the other literary, which I have recenlty came across and found them interesting. The first one is [Society of the Spectacle (1967)](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/debord/society.htm) by French philosopher and Marxist critical theorist Guy Debord. The book is a relentless analysis of the conditions of life that the Capitalism and market societies at the last stage of her development along with her own totalized system of values had established all over the Globe. Guy Debord was an influencial member of situationists movement who defined the _spectacle_ as _an assemblage of social relations transmitted via the imagery of class power, and as a period of capitalist development wherein "all that was once lived has moved into representation"_.
