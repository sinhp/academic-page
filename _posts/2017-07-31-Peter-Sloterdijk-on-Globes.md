excerpt: "Space as space of immunity"
---

Peter Sloterdijk is for many people for most of the time an impossible author. Many in academia and elsewhere will never consider him as serious thinker let alone a philosopher; for them he is at best a gifted contrarian. He certainly has a penchant for controversy and a tendency for use of extravagant language and extravagant use of language. In fact it is not uncommon to see from a German who is somewhat familiar with Sloterdijk, either through his writings or his numerous TV appearances, impatience with Sloterdijk's perceived imprecision and verbiage: "Sloterdijk - Nein, danke! Es ist nur Gelaber ..." 

Nonwithstanding, for more than three decades he has been one of Germany’s most proliferate and most controversial philosophers. His work, [a steady stream of ambitious philosophical books](https://newrepublic.com/article/113387/peter-sloterdijks-philosophy-gives-reasons-living), has been emerging in English translations more and more over the past fifteen years all over the world. He is currently Professor of Philosophy and Aesthetics at the Karlsruhe School of Design. 

What I have found interesting and unique in his thinking is his breaking away from dichotomies of others creations, and his reflections at a much more larger scale of world history. His writings are too literary to be deemed philosophical and yet too philosophical to be regarded only as work of literature. His philosophical thinking is not within categories and that is perhaps one of the most common difficulties of others to locate his place in philosophical tradition.  His language is as much spatial as temporal. Two of his biggest influencers are Nietzche and Heidegger, and also Plato and st. Augustine. 

His bestselling Critique of Cynical Reason (1983) earned him the German public attention like of which only "public intellectuals" such as Habermas have mustered in European intellectual life. Since his rise to fame and the [Habermas-Sloterdijk debacle](https://philosophynow.org/issues/26/Philosophical_Rumblings_in_the_German_Republic_Der_Philosophenstreit), Sloterdijk has been ridiculed and has been labelled as "dangerous thinker", "fascistoid", "crypto-Nazi", "an infantile attention-seeker", and perhaps most derogatory of all "the Lady Gaga of philosophy", a title for his most shocking bad taste.

I still have not found an opportunity to start indulging myself in wrestling with the thoughts in Peter Sloterdijk's celebrated magnum opus Sphären trilogy. However, I recently watched his lecture in Tate Britain on ideas of his book _Globen and relationship of thoses ideas to art_: for instance art of living in apartments as spaces of immunity.

Here is the `abstract` of his talk: 
> Peter Sloterdijk’s philosophico-morphological theory is based on an understanding of the history of culture as spatialisations of forms. The world in which we live now requires us to design new types of ‘spatialised immunity’. More broadly, the concept of a spherical logic of space – a polymorphologic of form, order and thinking – is explicated in Spheres, his three-volume archaeology of the human attempt to dwell within spaces, from womb to globe. The Spheres project (Bubbles, Globe, Foam) is a significant topological turn in the field of contemporary philosophy, ‘a super-workout for communicative energies capable of finding contact throughout the entire world.’
