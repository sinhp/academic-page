excerpt: "Space as space of immunity"
---

 For many people for most of the time he is an impossible author. Many in academia and elsewhere do not consider Peter Sloterdijk as serious thinker let alone a philosopher; for them he is at best a gifted contrarian. He certainly has a penchant for controversy and a tendency for use of extravagant language and extravagant use of language. In fact it is not uncommon to see from a German who is somewhat familiar with Sloterdijk, either through his writings or his numerous TV appearances, impatience with Sloterdijk's perceived imprecision and verbiage: "Sloterdijk - Nein, danke! Es ist nur Gelaber ..." 

Nonwithstanding, for more than three decades he has been one of Germany’s most proliferate and most controversial philosophers. His work, a [steady stream of ambitious philosophical books](https://newrepublic.com/article/113387/peter-sloterdijks-philosophy-gives-reasons-living), has been emerging in English translations more and more over the past fifteen years all over the world. He is currently Professor of Philosophy and Aesthetics at the Karlsruhe School of Design. 

What I have found interesting and unique in his thinking is his breaking away from dichotomies of others creations, and his reflections at a much more larger scale of world history. His writings are too literary to be deemed philosophical and yet too philosophical to be regarded only as work of literature. His philosophical thinking is not within categories and that is perhaps one of the most common difficulties of others to locate his place in philosophical tradition.  His language is as much spatial as temporal. Two of his biggest influencers are Nietzche and Heidegger, and also Plato and St. Augustine. 

His bestselling Kritik der zynischen Vernunft<sup>1</sup> (1983) earned him the German public attention like of which only "public intellectuals" such as Habermas have mustered in European intellectual life. Since his rise to fame and the [Habermas-Sloterdijk debacle](https://philosophynow.org/issues/26/Philosophical_Rumblings_in_the_German_Republic_Der_Philosophenstreit), Sloterdijk has been ridiculed and has been labelled as "dangerous thinker", "fascistoid", "crypto-Nazi", "an infantile attention-seeker", and perhaps most derogatory of all "the Lady Gaga of philosophy", a title for his allegedly most shocking bad taste.   

The above description of Sloterdijk's work is not meant to discourage you from reading him. In fact, the opposite is true. I am drawing attention to other's crititicism of him, justified or not, to tell you how to _not_ approach him. Once you know what is his craft you can find your through him without being disappointed, disgruntled, or feelling cringed, disgusted, or angry. First of all, it is not too hard to discover that Sloterdijk is a student of what he calls kynicism (the antithesis to cynicism). According to him, one finds the roots of kynicism in the figure of Diogenes of Sinope, or "Socrates gone mad". He clearly advocates the position of kynical combative philosophy in Critique of Cynical Reason:

> Greek kynicism discovers the animal body in the human and its gestures as arguments; it develops a pantomimic materialism. Diogenes refutes the language of philosophers with that of the clown: "When Plato put forward the definition of the human as a featherless biped and was applauded for it, he tore the feathers from a rooster and brought it into Plato's school saying, 'That is Plato's human';
as a result, the phrase was added: 'with flattened nails' " (Diogenes Laertius, vol. VI, p. 40). That—and not Aristotelianism —is the real-philosophical antithesis to Socrates and Plato. Plato and Aristotle are both master-thinkers, even if a spark
of Socrates' plebeian street philosophy is still present in the Platonic ironies and dialectic mannerisms. Diogenes and his followers countered this with an essentially plebeian reflection. Only the theory of this cheekiness can open up access to a political history of combative reflections. This makes the history of philosophy possible as dialectical social history: It is the history of the embodiment and the splitting of consciousness. 

Also, do not look for a unifying logical theme through works of Sloterdijk. His writing style is too much metaphorical, world-historical, and hyperbolisch to accommodate for a unified theme of ideas. He compensates for such lack with strongly-worded spatial metaphorical language: In Du mußt dein Leben ändern<sup>2</sup> he uses verticality of line as the spatial metaphor for self-elevation and reaching to the heights of "the Mount improbabale", or to borrow from Nietzsche’s Thus Spoke Zarathustra 
> Man is a rope, stretched between beast and Übermensch.

I still have not found an opportunity to start indulging myself in wrestling with the thoughts in Peter Sloterdijk's celebrated magnum opus Sphären trilogy. However, I recently watched his lecture in Tate Britain on ideas of his book _Globen and relationship of thoses ideas to art_: for instance art of living in apartments as spaces of immunity.

Here is the `abstract` of his talk: 
> Peter Sloterdijk’s philosophico-morphological theory is based on an understanding of the history of culture as spatialisations of forms. The world in which we live now requires us to design new types of ‘spatialised immunity’. More broadly, the concept of a spherical logic of space – a polymorphologic of form, order and thinking – is explicated in Spheres, his three-volume archaeology of the human attempt to dwell within spaces, from womb to globe. The Spheres project (Bubbles, Globe, Foam) is a significant topological turn in the field of contemporary philosophy, ‘a super-workout for communicative energies capable of finding contact throughout the entire world.’
