This article is about a Philosophy and Foundations of Mathematics Reading Group (PFMRG) that will be inaugurated in mid February. We meet bi-weekly, and each session will last about two hours (30-45 minutes for presentation, the rest for the Q&A). The goals of this group and the themes of the presentations are discussed in below.   



## Goals and hopes


The main goal of this reading group is to understand how close the human has come to the point where his machines can do mathematics for him. Some mathematicians, such the Fields medalists Paul Cohen, Tim Gowers, Maxim Kontsevich, and Vladimir Voedodsky  have all at some point predicted that computers will be able to out-reason mathematicians in the 21st century. But is that really plausible?

To make any sound judgment on this question, we need to better understand 

1. What is (and what should be regarded as) mathematical progress? 

2. What is (and what should be regarded as) mathematical proof? Do we always need formal proofs to do mathematics? (c.f. theorems vs [porisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porism) ) 

3. What is the role of human intuition in mathematical reasoning and in mathematical proofs? Where do new ideas in mathematics come from?  

4. What is the role of natural language in mathematics and how different is it from the mathematical languages in which the proofs are written? What are the limits of our mathematical languages compared to our natural language where we reason about mathematics at a meta level? And could these limits be problematic for the computers to do mathematics equally or even better than humans?  

5.  What is the machine mathematics? What are automated theorem provers (ATPs) and interactive theorem provers (ITPS) and what are their differences? Can the advances in AI, ML, and neuroscience bridge the gap between ATP+ITP and the human mind when it comes to doing (creating/discovering) interesting new mathematics? 

6. Will we have two mathematics in future: the machine mathematics, and the human mathematics? And how do we, humans, react to such a situation? Will we simply accept the proofs generated by computers which conceivably could not be understood by any human being at all?  Will such proofs have the same status as human generated proofs

These are pressing questions and we need to ransack various philosophies and foundations of mathematics that have been thought before us; they give us radically different insights to the questions above and presents us with cast territories of philosophical though. In the first session of our reading group, I will give an introductory talk charting out a basic map of these territories, and establishing some reading resources that get us going.  




## Which philosophies? which foundations? 


Here is a common sense and self-evident proposal: 

>_What mathematicians think and do should be important for the philosophy of mathematics._

Now, if you are not familiar with the current state of affairs in the philosophy of mathematics 
in academia, you are for a hard surprise that the proposal above could not be further from the reality of academic. 

Well, this reading group is a serious attempt to learn to think about mathematic again; we do not want to confine ourselves with the narrow and arcane framework of interests of the academic philosophy of mathematics. 

We shall try to ask worthy questions: 

>_When do we call a kind of knowledge mathematical? How does mathematical knowledge grow? What is mathematical progress? Whatm akes some mathematical ideas (or theories) better than others? What is mathematical explanation? etc_ 

I believe in epistemological anarchism, that is, if needed, we have to be receptive to ideas from the most disparate and apparently far-flung domains, even at the price of losing the comfort of our nests. 

Therefore, in this reading group we will remain open to all ideas and philosophies as long as they are helpful to our goals and hopes discussed in above. May this group be a place for deep learning (and deep unlearning/ unindoctorination) as well as unashamedly free speculations.   

We will review the main tenets of the following philosophies and foundations of mathematics: 

  * Constructivism and Intuitionism
  * Structuralism
  * Formalism
  * Fictionalism 
  * Cognitivism  


<p class="sans">In below, I list some of the references which I personally found interesting, intriguing, and edifying. Occasionally, we will discuss some of them, but we do not limit ourselves to them.</p>




### I have no clue what the philosophy of mathematics is about. Where should I begin?

  + [LOGICOMIX](https://www.logicomix.com/en/index.html)

For more serious (and mixed) introductory resources here are some selected papers to get an introduction to some of the most interesting and variegated issues in the philosophy of mathematics: 

   * [On Proof and Progress in Mathematics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9404236.pdf), See also

     + Where Mathematics Comes From: How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics into Being 
     The authors claim that the mathematics we used to describe as disembodied is in fact embodied. Humans use their bodies, mind, and brain to both form and understand mathematics. All mathematical content resides in embodied ideas and many of the most basic, as well as the most sophisticated, mathematical ideas are metaphorical.

## Thematized Resources 

   * On Proofs & Proof assistants
      + Richard Tieszen. What is a proof? 
      + Robert L. Constable. [Proof Assistants and the Dynamic Nature of Formal Theories](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-878/invited1.pdf)
      + Herman Geuvers. [Proof assistants: History, ideas and future](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~herman/ictopen.pdf) Also, look at these [slides](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~herman/ictopen.pdf) 
      + Hyperproofs
      + Proof core. The idea is due to the late philosopher David Charles McCarty. See [What are the limits of mathematical explanation?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uWS7Kwau1A&ab_channel=CopernicusCenterforInterdisciplinaryStudies) 
      Could _proof cores_ (idea engines that propel formal proofs) be one of the conceptual gaps between mathematical proofs and their formalizations? i.e. does a coding of proofs (w.r.t. a formal language) contains strictly less epistemic data/control the proofs themselves? (e.g. (geometric) proof core of -1. -1 = 1, verus one of its proof code in which integers are coded as pairs of natural numbers.)  Proof cores are more easily expressible in higher languages, and they are closer to intuition and mathematical cognition.
