## Where is Heidegger's thinking situtated? 

We note that Heidegger comes from a very conservative catholic background; his goal in his youth was to become a Catholic priest and he became one, indeed very much attracted to an extremely conservative Catholic priest and preacher of 17th century Abraham a Sancta Clara from near Messkirch the same region as Heidegger. In his time Sancta Clara was described as "a very eccentric but popular Augustinian monk". 

Heidegger soon broke with his Catholicism when in Austria and he gave up the path to fame from priesthood, the path his idol has treaded in 17th century, the provincial inclinations and bucolic elements     




Although Heidegger, after the turn (Kehre), takes an opposite view on the use of neologism in his thinking in [The End of Philosophy and The Task of Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qouZC17_Vsg), I still think that the precise use of neologism in Being and Time is an essential component of the masterpiece and necessary to what aims at delivering.  


Antihumanism 


As Peter Sloterdijk writes in 

> With this apparently modest twist,
Heidegger opened the possibility of cataclysmic consequences: Humanism, in its
ancient, in its Christian, as in its Enlightenment form, was revealed as the agent of a
2000-year denial. It was accused of having prevented, through its swiftly provided,
apparently self-evident, and irrefutable characterization of the nature of man, the
development of a more appropriate way to pose the question about the nature of
man. Heidegger explained that his work after [Sein und Zeit (1927)](https://taradajko.org/get/books/sein_und_zeit.pdf) 
was directed against
humanism, not because it overvalued humanity, but because it did not value humanity
highly enough ... For Heidegger there is no path
from humanism to this acute ontological exercise in humility. He sees it rather as a
contribution to the history of the disarmament of subjectivity. Actually, Heidegger
interprets the historical world of Europe as the theater of militant humanism; it is
the battlefield on which human subjectivity, with portentous consequences, has acted
out its domination over Being. From this perspective, humanism is seen as the natural
accomplice of all possible tortures which could be inflicted in the name of human
well-being.


Where is this hostility toward the humanist of movement is grounded in philosophy of Heidegger? 

> The question of the Being of Man will never be posed properly until we can distance
ourselves from the oldest, most enduring, and traditional product of European
metaphysics: the definition of man as rational animal. According to this definition,
man is characterized as an animal enriched by a spiritual supplement. Heidegger's
existential ^ ontological analysis rejects this understanding of man, since for him the
nature of man can never be expressed from a zoological or biological perspective, even
when a spiritual or transcendental component is consistently added. On this point Heidegger is completely adamant; indeed, he strides like an angry angel with crossed swords between beast and man, in order to deny any ontological
commonality between the two.
