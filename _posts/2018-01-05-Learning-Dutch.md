## A bit of context 

It was nearly a year ago when I decided to learn Dutch or Nederlands<sup>2</sup>, a term Dutch use to refer to their own language. My efforts to learn Dutch was not concerted at all and I only did it in my spare time and most often whenever I travel to Holland. At the moment I would describe my Dutch efficiency as modest. I can read easier parts of newspaper articles and columns, speak at a basic level and write some of weird Dutch words without a mistake. In my opinion, one of the difficulties to learn the language by yourself is to find approporiate and interesting learning resources you can stick too. In this post I am going to introduce some of resources I have found useful so far. Hopefully, there will be some Dutch learners and others who find this article interesting and helpful. I divide the list of resources into three categories: beginner, intermediate, and more challenging. 

I should also mention few good online dictionaries you may like to consistently use. Google Translate is an application that I frequently use. It has many downsides particularly when it comes to Dutch expresssions and proverbs and does not offer examples. It can best be used in tandem with either of following freely accessible online dictionaries: 

* [en.bab.la](https://en.bab.la/dictionary/dutch-english/)
* [nl.glosbe](https://nl.glosbe.com/nl/en/)

I also recommend to have [Wolters Woordenboek](https://www.boekwinkeltjes.nl/s/?q=Wolters+Woordenboek+Nederlands-Engels) hard-copy at hand. I like its completeness of entries and relevant examples.  


## For beginners

* **Dutch vocabulary: basic words** 
  * [OCR basic vocabulary list](http://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/74540-alphabetical-vocabulary-list-for-2013-papers.pdf)
    + [Flash cards (nouns)](https://tiny.cards/decks/Hd6jJYP7/ocr-woorden) 
  * [1000 most common words in Dutch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7t5HDxchqQ&list=PLUOa-qvvZolDeAYFOPqHRC9w8Nnx5cTcJ)

* **Duolingo**: Well, you've probably heard of it already. Duo's Dutch lessons are well-prepared and they are great for absolute beginners. Remember that in addition to exercise lessons on your phone app, there are concise grammar tips for every lesson which are accessible via Duolingo website. Here is an exmaple from the first lesson:

* **Donald Duck Junior** is arguably one of the most popular comic strip magazines (stripverhal) in Holland and beyond, with comics from Walt Disney characters . Check out [Donald Duck Junior website](https://www.donaldduck.nl/donald-duck-junior).  

* **Stuff Dutch people like**: Learning a language is not just about words and grammar. Here is a somewhat accurate [list](https://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/complete-list/) of things Dutch people in general like. "Hagelslag", "Scheduling agenda appointments", "Zwarte Piet", "Swearing with diseases", etc are noticeable. Treat it as an index of Dutch*ness*.   

* **Some Dutch expressions and idioms**: [Here](https://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/2016/03/08/funny-dutch-expressions/) is a list of few easy-to-remember and funny Dutch expressions you might like to learn. 

* **Dutch grammar books** 
  * [Dutch: An Essential Grammar](https://books.google.nl/books/about/Dutch.html?id=3aU0DgAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y) by William Z. Shetter and Esther Ham 
  * [Basic Dutch: A Grammar and Workbook](https://books.google.nl/books/about/Basic_Dutch_A_Grammar_and_Workbook.html?id=iRelBXxYRcIC&redir_esc=y) by Jenneke Oosterhoff

* **Naar Nederland** is an e-learning website designed to help people who take the _basisexamen inburgering in het buitenland_ administered by De Dienst Uitvoering Onderwijs (DUO). The exam is comprised of three components: 
   - Kennis van de Nederlandse Samenleving (KNS)
   - Leesvaardigheid
   - Spreekvaardigheid 
 
 On the e-learning section of [Naar Nederland](https://www.naarnederland.nl/voorbereidin) website you can find lots of interesting exercises on all of these components. Although the lessons are designed to help people who take the exam the material (including audio clips) are freely available to everyone and form a coherent and well-designed series of lessons. 
 

## Intermediate Stuff

* **De Canon van Nederland**
is a list of fifty topics that aims to provide a chronological summary of Dutch history to be taught in primary schools and the first two years of secondary school in the Netherlands. It was designed to provide an overview of "what everyone ought to know, at the very least, about the history and culture of the Netherlands", as well as providing a framework for the teaching of History in Dutch schools.
Check out the very cool website [entoen.nu](https://www.entoen.nu/) which hosts the canon material for use in schools and in society in general. You can create your own account and customize your learning chronological map according to your taste. 

* **Donald Duck** is a more serious version of Donald Duck Junior and yes it is read avidly by adults as well as young childrend and teenagers. Compared to Donald Duck Junior the stories are way longer and more interesting and range of vocubalaries vastly greater. I like them a lot and I have a stack of them at home. Here is the website: [donaldduck.nl/](https://www.donaldduck.nl/) 

* **[Intermediate Dutch: A Grammar and Workbook](https://books.google.nl/books?id=FCBp5NXeBrwC&source=gbs_book_similarbooks)** by Jenneke Oosterhoff

* **Children's books** 
Some children books have helped my learning process to be fun, faster and more interesting. Here are few of them:

  * **[Meneer Blijleven](https://www.givnbooks.nl/product/tolkien-j-r-r-meneer-blijleven/)** which is a Dutch translation of J.R.R.Tolkien's picture book [Mr.Bliss](https://wiki2.org/en/Mr._Bliss). The cool part is that the book includes Tolkien's story with his own handwriting and illustrations on even pages and nice Dutch translation on odd pages which makes reading the book in Dutch much easier for learners of the language. Another edition of the book with a Dutch review is available at [boekreviews.nl](http://www.boekreviews.nl/recensies/meneer-blijleven). 
 Here is my plea to you: please share with me if you know any books of this style.

  * **[Toon Tellegen](https://wiki2.org/en/Toon_Tellegen)'s children books**: So far I only looked at <q>Maar niet uit het hart. Dierenverhalen over afscheid</q>. You can find list of all his children books here: [Toon Tellegen bibliografie](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toon_Tellegen#Bibliografie).  
 
  * **[Filosofie In Beeld](https://www.boekencentrum.nl/filosofie-in-beeld)** is an illustrated journey through the history of Western philosophy by Margreet de Heer. It is fun to read, and pictures help a lot to understand the contexts and sentences even if you do not understand every Dutch word in the text. Other books by the same author: [Religie In Beeeld](https://www.boekencentrum.nl/religie-in-beeld), [Wetenschappen In Beeld](https://www.boekencentrum.nl/wetenschappen-in-beeld), and [Wereldschappij In Beeld](https://www.boekencentrum.nl/wereldheerschappij-in-beeld) 

## More Challenging

* **Geschiedenis.nl** is website with historical and cultural articles for the interest of broad public. Moreover, Geschiedenis.nl advise, leads, and holds lectures on projects in the fields of history and culture. 

* **Encyclopedia of Dutch expressions, idioms, and proverbs**: Find them at [spreekwoorden.nl](https://spreekwoorden.nl/).
If that is too much for you, just buy a pack of [Het Spreekwoorden spel](https://www.trendyspeelgoed.nl/Het-Spreekwoorden-spel.html) to play! 

* **Kranten (Newspapers)**: Among different Dutch newspapers and news sites, I recommend [Trouw](https://www.trouw.nl/). It is thorough in their news coverage, and has interesting society and culture, history, religion and philosophy, and green life columns. They also publsih review of books as well as interviews with book authors and other important figures. A more mainstream option is [NRC Handelsblad](https://www.nrc.nl/). 


* **Mathematics in Dutch**: Here is a list of mathematics (wiskunde) in Dutch. 
 * [BASISBOEK WISKUNDE](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.vandecraats/BasisboekWiskunde2HP.pdf): an open-ended online book by Jan van de Craats en Rob Bosch.

1. Description: De stenen brug. Landschap met een stenen brug over een rivier of vaart. Op het water bevinden zich twee bootjes met figuren. Op de weg lopen verschillende personen, links een wagen. In het midden een hooischuur tussen bomen, rechts in de verte een kerktoren. More at [rijksmuseum.nl](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-A-1935). 

2. Nether means _situated down or below_ and _lower_, and the word Nederland literally refers to [the Low Countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Countries). For instance, kan je nederlands spreken?.  <q>Koninkrijk der Nederlanden</q> (Kingdom of the Netherlands) is used officially to refer to Dutch Kingdom, and Nederland (singular) is used for the modern nation.
